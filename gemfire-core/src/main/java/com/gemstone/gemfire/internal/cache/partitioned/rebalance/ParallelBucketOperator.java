/**
 * A bucket operator that will perform operations on a bucket asynchronously.

 * delegate bucket operator is expected to move the bucket and notify the
 * Completion within the scope of the call to create bucket.
 * 
 * What this class does in make that call asynchronous. A task to create the
 * bucket is handed to the thread pool and executed there. After it is done, the
 * completion is notified.
 * 
 * Calling waitForOperations waits for all previously submitted operations and 
 * ensures the completions are notified.
 * 
 * Note that only createRedundantBucket is asynchronous, the rest of the 
 * operations are synchronous.
